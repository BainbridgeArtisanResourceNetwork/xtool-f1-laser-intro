#  SVG Prep Checklist for Laser Cutting with xTool Creative Space

This checklist helps ensure smooth importing and correct operation setup in XCS.

---

## ✅ Basic Cleanup

- [ ] **Convert all text to paths/outlines**  
  Prevents font substitution or missing text on other computers.

- [ ] **Ungroup and flatten**  
  Eliminate groups, layers, masks, and compound paths if possible.

- [ ] **Remove clipping masks and filters**  
  These can confuse XCS or cause missing elements.

- [ ] **Clean metadata and hidden layers**  
  Use "Save As → Plain SVG" if exporting from Inkscape or Illustrator.

## 🎨 Color & Stroke Guidelines (for XCS)

- [ ] **Use clear stroke/fill colors to represent different operations**  
  While XCS doesn't auto-map black = engrave, distinct colors help you separate layers manually.

- [ ] **Optional: Use thin strokes (e.g., 0.1 mm) for cuts, filled shapes for engraves**  
  This improves visual clarity, though not required for XCS recognition.

- [ ] **Avoid semi-transparent fills**  
  XCS does not interpret opacity the way design tools do.

## 📏 Scale and Units

- [ ] **Set artboard/document size to match project (mm or inches)**  
  Avoid unexpected scaling — match XCS workspace units.

## 🧪 Test Before Running

Always test one of your SVGs in XCS after export to verify:
- Visibility of all parts
- No missing paths
- Correct alignment and sizing
