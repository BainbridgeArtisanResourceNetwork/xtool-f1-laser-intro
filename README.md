# XTool F1/F1 Ultra laser intro

Introduction to the XTool F1 and F1 Ultra lasers - supporting files and documents.

Files and documents useful for using the F1 series lasers at BARN, especially intended to support the Introduction to the F1 laser class.

If you're taking the class, and have a laptop computer, you can install the software we will be using ahead of time.
This will enable you to work along in the class more easily. (We have a small number of computers that will be available too.)

Instructor will provide a USB flash drive with the required files day of class, but feel free to install it sooner.
