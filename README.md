# XTool-F1-laser-intro
Introduction to the XTool F1 laser - supporting files and documents.

Files and documents useful for using the F1 laser at BARN, especially intended to support the Introduction to the F1 laser class.

If you're taking the class, and have a laptop computer, you can install the software we will be using ahead of time.
This will enable you to work along in the class more easily. (We have a small number of computers that will be available too.)
